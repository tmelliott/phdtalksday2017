With the latest advancements in technology, notably the GPS, 
it is now possible to obtain position information of all buses
in Auckland via a publicaly accesible API.
However, turning these positions into arrival time estimates 
is more complicated than it sounds - 
factors such as traffic congestion, wait times at intermediate 
bus stops, and delays caused by traffic lights all introduce
additional uncertainty and, more often than not, result in the bus
taking longer than originally thought.
My approach is to independently model all buses, but then combine
this by estimating the state (vehicle speed) along individual 
roads in the network; this way, the network state is updated as buses
drive along their routes. The network state can then be used to 
make a more informed and, hopefully, more accurate arrival time prediction.
