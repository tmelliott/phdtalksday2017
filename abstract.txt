An estimated time of arrival (ETA) that increases is inherantly bad:
your bus is 5 minutes away, and then two minutes later, its 6 minutes away!
The main reason for this is that traffic conditions between you and the bus
aren't being taken into account.
I'm investigating an approach to predicting bus arrival that models 
buses (implemented using a particle filter) to estimate their speed
along roads within the network, which is in turn used to update the 
traffic state (that is, how long it takes a bus to travel along
an individual road). This information can then be used to 
make more informed predictions for upcoming buses,
hopefully producing ETAs that account - somewhat accurately - for
the congestion between you and that bus.
